Accessing the Outook for automating the daily task.


Accessing my office outlook mailbox for automating the daily task template. 

Task which has been performed

1) Login into the outlook mailbox
2) Choosing the particular folder instead of all the folders.
3) Downloaded the mails from the particular folder for 1 day period
4) The mail content is splitted using split function and saved in an excel.

Precautions:-
Once you run the code. The unread mails will turn to read. No issues for me as i will be running the code at the end of the day. 

need to work on the below:-
Saving in excel needs to be done in more better way. 
Adding mail sending option after the excel is created.
